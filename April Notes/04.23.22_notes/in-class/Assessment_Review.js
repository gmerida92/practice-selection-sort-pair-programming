//? Q1. Which of the following is the default value for the CSS position property for HTML elements?
//? float
//? block
//? hidden
// !static
// E: The browser defaults an HTML element's position to be static within the layout flow. Thus, "static" value is the default
// value for the position property of HTML elements

//? Q2. Select all of the options that CSS would interpret as the color solid red.
//? rgb(1, 0, 0)
//? rgba(255, 0, 0, 0)
//! #FF0000
//! #F00
//! rgb(255, 0, 0)
//! red
// E: #F00 and #FF000 are both valid hex-values for colors. rgb and rgba color values are from 1-255, so rgb(1, 0, 0) would render
// as nearly black.The alpha value in rgba is from 0 - 1, so rgba(255, 0, 0, 0) would render as transparent.

//? Q3. What is the most appropriate semantic HTML tag for the "Featuring" text?
//! h2

// E: This is an image which should use an img tag. The same feature could also be accomplished using a div with a background-image CSS property,
// but it is less appropriate since the image is not in the background of any other elements.

//? Q14. When using the rgba() method of specifying a color for the browser to render, what is the alpha value that will give the color 50% opacity?
//! .5
// E: The correct answer is "0.5" which indicates that the alpha channel has an opacity value of 50%.
